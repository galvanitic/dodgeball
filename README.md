 Austin Coding Academy - Checkpoint 2

# Overview
We are in need of a sorting and organizing app for our community dodge ball league. There are already 6 players signed up and we hope to get more! We need to select from our currently sign-up people to make them dodge ball players and from there we need to be able to select them to be on different teams. Please look over the Specs Checklist to make sure you understand the needs of this app.


# Code Plan
Upon click of "make player"
add the person to players array, add the key-value "player: new" and remove them from people object
if blue clicked, add player to bluePlayers array, remove the player from the player array. Extend the keys "color" and "mascot".
